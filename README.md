# DiscreteHopfieldModel
Solution to a Discrete Hopfield Algorithm problem which was given as an assignment in Bogazici University, Istanbul, Turkey

In the problem, 5 letters (A, C, K, T, W) are given as patterns and a Discrete Hopfield Model is requested to be built to recognize disturbed patterns of these letters. The algorithm is tested in 3 cases in which disturbance deviations are increased gradually. The code can be used for further applications. It only requires changes in input patterns.
